### Proposed Level of Achievement: 
Apollo 11

### Motivation: 
There are definitely times when we want to be productive, but just lack the motivation to complete our tasks. So what better way is there to push yourself to stay focused than having your friends monitor your progress? 

But everyone leads busy lives in today’s fast-paced society, so it might not always be possible to meet up with your friends to study or work together. When faced with this problem, it does not mean that you cannot still be productive on your own. 

With the use of BeFocused, users will still be able to connect with friends and update each other on their progress. Right now, there is probably nothing more popular than social media platforms, so we want to incorporate the interactive aspects of social media into our app to make it seem more novel and captivating to potential users.  


### Project Scope: 
BeFocused is the ultimate productivity app that combines concentration features with social media sharing.

User Stories: 
1. On entering the app, users need to set a certain period of time in which they wish to study/work, through a clock interface. 
2. During the set period of time, users can only pause or exit the app with the use of coins
3. The app will prompt users at random times to take a photo of themselves working/studying as well as the progress of their work. 
4. After the timer ends, users are rewarded with coins and a timeline of the users’ study/work session will be posted for the user’s friends to view. 
5. Each user can only see their friends’ timeline after their session ends. If a user did not manage to complete their session, they will not be able to view others’ timelines.

Core Features: 
1. Clock interface
    1. Allows the user to indicate the time and duration they wish to study/ work for that day 
    2. Allows the user to click “start” to begin a session 
    3. Allows the user to click “pause” and “end” to pause or end a session early (requires the use of coins)
    4. User can choose to listen to music during the session (some free ones, buy others with coins)
2. Progress update interface
    1. At random times, there will be a notification and a button for the user to press to turn on the camera to take a picture of their progress
    2. Snoozing is possible using coins; if user doesn’t press snooze or take a photo within 2 min, auto-snooze happens (coins spent)
3. Social interface 
    1. Allows the user to view friends’ timelines only after user has successfully completed a focus session that day
    2. If user hasn’t finished a session that day, they can spend coins for a one-time viewing of their feed (eg. 10 coins for 10 min)
4. Coins system
    1. Users will earn coins by completing an uninterrupted focus session; pausing/quitting/snoozing the camera prompt requires the spending of coins  
    2. Coins can buy better study music
    3. Users can spend coins to view feed without having to complete a focus session that day
